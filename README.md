# Portfolio Optimization
Portfolio optimization is a financial strategy aimed at selecting the best mix of assets to maximize returns while minimizing risk. The process involves determining the proportion of various assets in a portfolio that balances the investor's risk tolerance and investment goals.

Key aspects of portfolio optimization include:

Risk and Return: The main goal is to maximize the expected return for a given level of risk or to minimize risk for a given level of expected return.
Diversification: Spreading investments across different assets or asset classes to reduce risk.
Efficient Frontier: A concept in modern portfolio theory that represents a set of optimal portfolios offering the highest expected return for a defined level of risk.
Mean-Variance Optimization: A mathematical framework developed by Harry Markowitz that helps in identifying the optimal portfolio by considering the expected returns, variances, and covariances of different assets.
Constraints: Investors might face constraints such as budget limits, investment policies, or regulatory requirements that need to be considered in the optimization process.
Portfolio optimization is widely used by financial analysts and investors to construct portfolios that align with their financial objectives while managing the inherent risks.
# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
In this project, I developed a Monte Carlo simulation model for portfolio optimization with the objective of maximizing an investor's returns on a specified investment amount. The model was applied to stocks from major investment firms, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and J.P. Morgan. The simulation involved constructing and analyzing portfolios that combined various asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and alternative investments. The focus was on maximizing expected returns while effectively managing risk.
# About the project
In this project, I developed a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation model for portfolio optimization, focusing initially on major investment firms like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and J.P. Morgan. The objective was to maximize an investor's returns on a specified investment amount by forecasting stock prices and predicting the optimal weights for each asset to achieve maximal returns while minimizing risk.

The analysis involved constructing and evaluating portfolios composed of various asset classes, including stocks, bonds, and alternative investments. I employed various risk-return measures, such as the Sharpe ratio, to generate the optimal portfolio, and I discussed normality quantification techniques, including Q-Q plots, to ensure the robustness of the model. Additionally, I analyzed the relationships between different assets using correlation and covariance matrices, providing deeper insights into the diversification benefits and risk management strategies for the investor.

Upon completing the analysis for the investment firms, I extended the same methodology to Indian banks, including SBI, HDFC, Punjab National Bank, and Axis Bank. The process involved using the Monte Carlo simulation to forecast stock prices and applying the same risk-return optimization techniques to determine the optimal portfolio. This expansion allowed for a broader application of the model, offering insights into both global investment firms and major Indian financial institutions, thereby providing a comprehensive approach to portfolio optimization across different markets.
